  "Immigration1.0-22482": "A Set of Borders to Cross; For Children Seeking Immigrant Relatives in U.S., Journey Is Twofold\n\nSeventeen-year-old Guillermo Antonio Iraheta Hernandez traveled thousands of miles from his native El Salvador only to land in limbo.\n\nLeft behind more than a decade ago by his parents, illegal immigrants living in Northern Virginia, Iraheta made part of his trek to the United States hidden in the baggage compartment of a Mexican bus. But soon after surreptitiously crossing the Rio Grande into Texas, he was picked up by the Border Patrol and brought here to a converted nursing home run by the federal government where 136 children from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala are temporarily housed.\n\nIraheta is but one drop in a new and fast-growing stream of illegal immigration to the United States, those under 18 who are sneaking into the country without their parents. Authorities say the phenomenon is growing and includes girls traveling alone and even toddlers being carried by older siblings or entrusted to smugglers.\n\nMany of those who are apprehended by the Border Patrol end up in a burgeoning network of shelters set up by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. There they run up against Washington's paradoxical approach to the problem of children who entered the country illegally without their parents. The government agency that runs the shelters tries to reunite the children with relatives living here, regardless of their legal status. Another federal agency works to deport them  --  as well as their parents. Iraheta's mother and father are reluctant to come forward to claim their son, fearing that would lead to being sent back to El Salvador. So are his sisters, who are also in the country illegally. Even uncles who are legal U.S. residents living in Texas have stayed away.\n\n", 
  "Immigration1.0-22338": "LAY OFF THE GUEST WORKER WE WANT\n\nIt's hard to find anything that makes sense about U.S. immigration policy these days. As if Congress hasn't messed things up enough, the Justice Department has contributed to the absurd theater by prosecuting ridiculous cases.\n\nHere is one.\n\nTen years ago, Pedro Zapeta came to this country illegally from Guatemala. He wound up in Stuart, and became perhaps the greatest dishwasher the city has ever had.\n\nHe washed dishes at Alice's Restaurant, Chantal's cafe, Koi Japanese Restaurant, Shell's and Wahoo's on the waterfront, among others. If you dined in Stuart more than a few times in the past decade, odds are you've eaten off one of his plates.\n\nMr. Zapeta also did landscaping work on the side. He worked two jobs at a time, never earning more than $7.50 an hour. Through Spartan frugality only a Guatemalan would understand, Mr. Zapeta was able to save as much as he spent, and hid the cash in the room he shared with other immigrants.\n\nBy September 2005, he had saved about $60,000. He decided that it was time to return to his family in the village of Totonicapan and use the money to start a business. For him, it was the fortune of a lifetime.\n\nHe bought a U.S. Airways ticket, stuffed $59,000 in cash into a duffel bag, then headed for Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. That is where his nightmare began.\n\n", 
  "Immigration1.0-22484": "Would ban on renting to illegals make sense here?\n\nGwinnett has something in common with Escondido, Calif.\n\nIt's illegal immigration.\n\nIn this California community, though, there's at least one distinct difference. The city's leaders, weary of the federal government's doublespeak and wordplay when it comes to immigration reform, have taken matters into their own hands.\n\nThey've hunkered down.\n\nOn Wednesday, by a 3-2 vote, the City Council approved an ordinance that bans landlords from renting to illegal immigrants. Barring legal challenges --- and there will be some --- the prohibition will take effect Nov. 18, according to wire stories.\n\nUnder the law, landlords will be required to submit to the city documentation of their tenants' immigration status. The city, in return, will pass the information on to the feds for verification.\n\nIf the tenants are found to be illegal immigrants, landlords will have 10 days to evict them or face a business license suspension. Repeat offenders could incur misdemeanor charges and fines.\n\nAnyone who suspects someone is renting to illegals can file a complaint. But complaints based solely on a person's national origin, race or ethnicity won't be allowed. (It's unclear how this will be verified.)\n\nEscondido has followed the lead of a handful of cities across the United States that have adopted renters laws. Other communities probably are weighing similar feel good, stopgap, legal and morally debatable steps to curb the presence and flow of undocumented workers.\n\n", 
  "Immigration1.0-25457": "Immigrants Pull Weight In Economy, Study Finds\n\nImmigrants contribute nearly one-fourth of the economic output of New York State, and outside of New York City, they are overrepresented in some of the most critical occupations, including higher education and health care, according to a study to be released today.\n\nIn the suburbs north and east of the city, about 4 of every 10 doctors and more than one-fourth of college professors were foreign-born, the study by the private Fiscal Policy Institute found. In upstate New York, where just 5 percent of residents are foreign-born, immigrants accounted for about one-fifth of the professors and more than one-third of the doctors, according to the study.\n\nThe study, conducted over the past year, concluded that the contributions of people born outside the country have spread far beyond the low-wage, low-skill work often associated with immigrants. Most immigrants meld into New York communities, learn to speak English and buy homes, it found. The institute is an independent research organization that focuses on public policy in New York State.\n\n''We just felt like there was such a deep misunderstanding about who immigrants were that the political discourse often got far afield from any factual basis of what's really going on here,'' said David D. Kallick, a senior fellow at the institute and the principal author of the study, ''Working for a Better Life.''\n\nThe study included foreign-born New York residents who have lived in the country for decades, as well as new arrivals, and included legal and illegal immigrants to capture the full immigrant experience, Mr. Kallick said.\n\n", 
  "Immigration1.0-25450": "The Citizenship Surge\n\nAbout the only point of agreement on immigration in this country is that newcomers who play by the rules -- fill out their forms, pay their fees and wait their turn -- are welcome. But that great American dogma is being sorely tested by the inability of the federal government's feeble citizenship agency to deal with a flood of applications that arose this summer.\n\nThe agency, Citizenship and Immigration Services, is telling legal immigrants that applications for citizenship and for residence visas filed after June 1 will take about 16 to 18 months to process. The agency was utterly unprepared for the surge, and so tens of thousands of Americans-in-waiting will have to keep on waiting. Many, gallingly, may have to sit out next November's election, even though that civic act was what prompted many of them to apply in the first place.\n\nThis was not supposed to happen. The director of Citizenship and Immigration Services, Emilio Gonzalez, promised this summer that the era of bad, slow service was over. He said a whopping increase in fees that took effect July 30 -- an average of about 66 percent across the board, with naturalization now costing $675 per person, up from $400 -- was about to make his agency fit for the 21st century. Speaking to newly naturalized immigrants, Mr. Gonzalez promised immediate results.\n\nOne immediate result was entirely predictable: people rushed to get their paperwork in. The agency received nearly 2.5 million naturalization petitions and visa applications in July and August, more than double from those months last year. But Mr. Gonzalez's spokesman, Bill Wright, told Julia Preston in Friday's  Times: ''We certainly were surprised by such an immediate increase.'' Surprised and swamped. The agency's processing center in Vermont is only now acknowledging naturalization petitions that came in by July 30.\n\n", 
  "Immigration1.0-948": "HISPANICS PUSHING CITIZENSHIP DRIVE\n\nSaying current laws make immigration difficult and citing a rising wave of anti-immigrant feeling, prominent Hispanic leaders are urging some 150,000 permanent residents from Central and South America who live in Queens to become American citizens.\n\n\"The doors are closing down,\" said Elizabeth Aivars, a Venezuelan-born attorney with the city's Law Department. \"It's important for these people to become American citizens and exercise their right to vote.\"\n\nThe cry for action emerged during the recent day-long First Hispanic Leadership Congress, held in Long Island City, where Hispanic leaders troubled by what they called a rising anti-immigration feeling sweeping the country vowed to double their aggressive drives to increase citizenship and voting registration among the Hispanic residents of Queens.\n\n\"The next presidential election in this country is going to be a question of life or death,\" said Kathy Andrade, an officer with the Hispanic Labor Committee, who told an immigration forum that Hispanic residents need to get involved in a wide range of issues such as the proposed sale of Elmhurst Hospital Center, and electing politicians to represent their interests.\n\nArmed with the latest set of figures she could get from the city Department of Planning, Aivars said some 381,120 Hispanic people live in Queens roughly 20% of the total borough population. The Hispanic population in the borough has experienced a 44.6% growth since 1980, according to city figures.\n\n", 
  "Immigration1.0-34932": "The Unluckiest Cubans\n\nThe story sounds like Dickens, rewritten by Kafka and updated by Joseph Heller:\n\nThe exhausted Cuban refugee confronts a stern immigration official who asks, ''Have you ever been in prison?'' He has, briefly, for a bit of black marketeering frowned upon by Fidel Castro. In Cuba he would lie about it, but this is America. So he tells the truth, and is hustled off to a penitentiary. He is ''excludable.''\n\nEventually he gets a hearing, but it doesn't go well. He lacks court records and witnesses, yet the burden is on him to prove that he is not a dangerous criminal. As it sinks in that he might remain locked up indefinitely, he wonders if it wouldn't be better to return to Cuba, to take his chances. But the Cubans won't hear of it.\n\nFinally outrage takes over. What about the wonderful American Constitution? Ah, that only applies to people who are in America.  Because he is ''excludable,'' at least legally, he is not yet ''in'' America.\n\nBut of course this K. and 1,800 other Cuban emigres who are being held as excludables are most decidedly in America. Some have serious criminal records and would pose a danger if set free. But many appear to have only slightly blemished records. No one knows for sure. The immigration laws, however, do not entitle them to the presumption of innocence, and so the doubt works against them. The situation so disturbed a Federal judge in Kansas that he ordered the release of a 48-year-old Cuban inmate in whom he recognized no ''threat to public safety.'' The man remains in prison pending appeal.\n\n", 
  "Immigration1.0-940": "In a Shift, U.S. Grants Asylum For Mexicans\n\nThe United States has quietly granted political asylum to at least 55 Mexican citizens in the last 14 months, a major shift after many years in which virtually all asylum applications from Mexicans were routinely rejected.\n\nImmigrants-rights advocates hail these grants of asylum, which are made by individual Federal immigration agents and judges on a case-by-case basis, as a collective milestone that amounts to formal recognition by the United States that political repression occurs in Mexico. But the actions have created a growing diplomatic headache for the Clinton Administration by angering the Mexican Government and the ruling party that has dominated the country for more than 60 years.\n\nThe asylum approvals come during a time of huge increases in the numbers of such applications from Mexicans. Applications increased to 9,304 in the 1995 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, from 6,397 in 1993 and from only 122 in 1990. From 1990 through 1993, not a single asylum application was approved; in 1994 five were approved, and in the most recent fiscal year it was 54.\n\nThe cause of the increase is itself the subject of intense debate. Advocates for those seeking asylum say the increase reflects the Mexican public's growing opposition to the ruling political party and asylum applicants' fears of retaliation for their political activities. But Federal immigration officials say that much of the increase represents fraudulent applications submitted by Mexicans seeking to take advantage of a loophole in the asylum law that allowed them to work legally in the United States pending review of an asylum request.\n\n", 
  "Immigration1.0-34939": "The Talk of Virgin Islands; GROWTH BRINGS PROBLEMS TO VIRGIN ISLANDS AS IMMIGRATION PUTS A STRAIN ON SERVICES\n\nThe water pipes, recalcitrant on the golf greens and nearly always dry in the housing projects, had been coughing air downtown for six days. Ann Johnson, proprietor of The Snack Box, a local lunch counter, apologized for the paper plates and cups.\n\n''We've had a water emergency since December 1976,'' she said. ''We got the garbage emergency in January 1979; they cut off the downtown pickups. We have power emergencies and the road emergency, and then we have the school emergency. The only emergency we don't have is on sunshine.''\n\nShe stood, flushing pink in the heat, watching the hamburgers on the propane grill. ''I've been mugged, hit over the head with a gun, and every member of my family has been robbed. And groceries,'' she sighed. ''We used to say that no matter what you bought, it was $10 a sack. Now it's $30. The price of food is higher than it is in Washington, D.C.''\n\nThe Johnsons came to St. Thomas from the mainland 18 years ago, but now they are thinking of going back. ''We have the feeling we're not wanted,'' Mrs. Johnson said.\n\nWhen the jet plane opened the Virgin Islands, a United States territory, to large-scale tourism in the 1960's, and to large-scale industrial development, the Johnsons were only two in a torrent of outsiders who flooded into the islands to share in the boom. There were merchants, construction workers, hotel workers and refinery workers. Some, like the Johnsons, black as well as white, came from the states because they were looking for a tropical way of life. Others, mostly black, came from the desperately poor islands of the Eastern Caribbean, looking only for a few dollars to send home.\n\n", 
  "Immigration1.0-20427": "By Dave Montgomery\n\nFrom the earliest days of the Republic, when Congress enacted the 1795 Naturalization Act restricting citizenship to ``free white persons,'' few issues have stirred deeper passions in the nation of immigrants than immigration itself. The current debate over how to deal with up to 12 million illegal residents is easily the most complex and divisive issue confronting the 109th Congress, exacerbated by demands to safeguard America's borders in the post-Sept. 11 era.\n\nPresident Bush has made enactment of a comprehensive immigration bill, including a temporary ``guest-worker'' program, a top priority. But his plummeting approval rating has weakened his influence over Congress, particularly while many lawmakers are seeking re-election in November.\n\nThe House of Representatives passed a tough immigration bill in December that emphasized strict border enforcement and criminal penalties for undocumented immigrants and those who employ them. A less punitive Senate measure, which included a guest-worker program and a path for undocumented workers to win legal status and eventual citizenship, suffered a potentially fatal setback this month with the collapse of a bipartisan compromise. Senate leaders say they will try to regroup after Congress returns from a two-week recess April 24.\n\nThe ultimate outcome will probably be decided by House and Senate negotiators, who face the herculean task of trying to bridge differences between the two sharply different measures when election-year passions make compromise difficult. With only six months before Congress adjourns, no one is betting on the outcome.\n\n"
